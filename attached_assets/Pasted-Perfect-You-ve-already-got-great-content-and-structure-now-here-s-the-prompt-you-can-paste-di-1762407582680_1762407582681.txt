Perfect 👍 You’ve already got great content and structure — now here’s the **prompt you can paste directly into Replit** (or any AI website builder tool) to create your **colorful, responsive personal portfolio** with all the functionality you described.

### 💡 **Prompt for Replit:**

Create a **colorful, modern, responsive personal portfolio website** for **Anjana Tulasi D**, using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React preferred)**.

#### 🔷 Design Requirements:

* Use a **clean, tech-style theme** (soft gradients, rounded cards, hover effects).
* Include **smooth scrolling** between sections (Experience, Skills, Projects, Education, Contact).
* Use a **sticky header bar** at the top of every page.

#### 🔗 **Header Section (Top of Image / Visible on All Pages):**

Add **four rounded icon buttons** aligned horizontally above or near my image:

1. **LinkedIn** → link to `https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjana-tulasi`
2. **GitHub** → link to `https://github.com/anjanatdeverapalli`
3. **Email** → link to open `mailto:anjanatdeverapalli@gmail.com`
4. **Resume (PDF)** → link to `/AnjanaTulasi_D_.pdf` (opens in new tab)

These four buttons should appear in the **header of all pages**, and have subtle hover animations and color accents (LinkedIn blue, GitHub dark gray, Email orange, Resume teal).

#### 🔶 **Landing Page:**

* Display name: **Anjana Tulasi D** in bold large font.
* Add title: *DevOps & Middleware Engineer* below name.
* Include a **short summary paragraph** (use text from the first image you uploaded).
* On the right side, display **my photo**.
* Below the bio, add buttons for navigation:

  * **Experience**
  * **Skills**
  * **Projects**
  * **Education**
  * **Contact**
* When clicked, each button should scroll smoothly to its section.

#### 🔷 **Sections (based on your screenshots):**

1. **Experience**

   * Show cards for each role (use data from screenshots: Vodafone, St. Cloud, etc.)
   * Include job title, company, location, and dates.
   * Add bullet points for achievements.

2. **Skills**

   * Create colorful tags or badges for each skill group (Programming, Cloud, Middleware, DevOps Tools, etc.).

3. **Projects**

   * Use cards or tiles with project titles, brief description, and technology stack.
   * Include your **publication link** for the IoT project.

4. **Education**

   * Add degree, university, and country.
   * Separate undergrad and graduate sections.

5. **Contact**

   * Simple contact form (Name, Email, Message).
   * When submitted, it should send an email via `mailto:` or show a thank-you message.

#### 🎨 **Color Palette Suggestion:**

* Primary: `#4A90E2` (Blue)
* Secondary: `#50E3C2` (Teal)
* Background: light gradient of blue/white
* Text: dark gray (`#222`)
* Buttons: rounded with hover shadows

#### ⚙️ **Technical:**

* Use **React Router** or single-page smooth scroll navigation.
